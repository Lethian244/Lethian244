- Hi, I’m Kanae, I'm a student at the University of Tuebingen
- I’m interested in learning algorithms that provide the possibility of analysing Spin-Spin interactions in QMBS
- I am currently working on a mathematical characterization of Quantum Neural Networks
- And implementing algorithms of Tropical Hurwitz Theory
